    <p>Subhas Bose, aged 24, arrived ashore in India at Bombay on the morning of 16 July 1921 and immediately set about arranging
    an interview with Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi, aged 51, was the leader of the non-cooperation movement that had taken India by
    storm the previous year and in a quarter-century would evolve to secure its independence.[ax][ay] Gandhi happened to be in
    Bombay and agreed to see Bose that afternoon. In Bose's account of the meeting, written many years later, he pilloried Gandhi
    with question after question.[91] Bose thought Gandhi's answers were vague, his goals unclear, his plan for achieving them not
    thought through.[91] Gandhi and Bose differed in this first meeting on the question of means- for Gandhi non-violent means to
    any end were non-negotiable; in Bose's thought, all means were acceptable in the service of anti-colonial ends.[91] They differed
    on the question of ends- Bose was attracted to totalitarian models of governance, which were anathematized by Gandhi.[92] According
    to historian Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C. R. Das, and
    in him Bose found the leader whom he sought."[91] Das was more flexible than Gandhi, more sympathetic to the extremism that had attracted
    idealistic young men such as Bose in Bengal.[91] Das launched Bose into nationalist politics.</p>
